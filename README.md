# Conversion Assignment 

## Getting Started
This is a visual studio 2022 project. It was written using the C++ libraries in visual studio 2022, and will require such to use. It's actual code should run on older versions 
of visual studio or in other editors, but no solutions for those versions are provided. There is no current release version of this project. 

## Purpose
This was a class assignment that is intented to convert differnt types of numbers. Primarily, Decimals, Hex, and Binary all amongst eachother. 

## Benefits
I learned about binary and hex many times before, but after manually coding the translations between the numbers I feel like I have a deeper understanding of these different types of numbers.
In addition, the floating point conversion has allowed me to learn more about how to convert floats, and the different approaches to it.

## Status
This is an assignment, and it is currently finished. I have no plans to expand this as an individual assignment, but it may be incorperated into a larger project.
